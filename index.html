            <h3>Sydney, Australia's favourite Harbour City</h3>
            <p>
              Sydney is the capital city of the state of New South Wales and the
              most populous city in Australia. Located on Australia's east
              coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about
              80 km (50 mi) from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Blue
              Mountains in the west, and about 80 km (50 mi) from Ku-ring-gai
              Chase National Park and the Hawkesbury River in the north and
              north-west, to the Royal National Park and Macarthur in the south
              and south-west. Greater Sydney consists of 658 suburbs, spread
              across 33 local government areas. Residents of the city are
              colloquially known as "Sydneysiders". The estimated population in
              June 2024 was 5,557,233 which is about 66% of the state's
              population. The city's nicknames include the Emerald City and the
              Harbour City.
